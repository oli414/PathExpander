# PathExpander
An OpenRCT2 plugin that lets you expand paths to their full size.

Use this plugin with care. This plugin lets you select a region, and all path elements within that region will have all their edges connected like you can do using the tile inspector. Keep in mind that paths with connections to nowehere will mess with the peep AI, so only use it where needed, or in placed where peeps can't come.
